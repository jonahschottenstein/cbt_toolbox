# CBT Toolbox

![CBT Toolbox Logo](link_to_your_logo_image.png)

## Project Description

**CBT Toolbox** is a mobile application based on the **Zones of Regulation**, a self-regulation framework rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This application is designed to empower children and neurodivergent adults to create custom sets of tools to help them manage their feelings in challenging circumstances.

## Motivation

The inspiration behind **CBT Toolbox** comes from personal experience. I have an older brother with Autism Spectrum Disorder who sometimes struggles with self-regulation. Over the years, he has learned tools to help with self-regulation, many of which are taught using the Zones of Regulation framework. The Zones of Regulation categorizes feelings, states of alertness, and energy levels into four colored Zones - Blue, Green, Yellow, and Red. This framework provides a simple and common language along with a visual structure that makes the complex skill of regulation more concrete for learners and their support network.

However, a common challenge observed was that when my brother is in the Red Zone (a state of extremely high energy and intense, overwhelming feelings), he often has difficulty remembering his self-regulation tools or motivating himself to use them. The primary reason for building this project was to create an easily accessible solution to assist my brother, and other individuals with the same challenge, in returning from the Red Zone to the Green Zone, a calm and alert state.

## Why I Built This Project

This project was built with two main objectives in mind:

1. **Accessibility**: Recognizing that individuals, like my brother, often have their phones with them at all times, a mobile application was chosen as the ideal platform. In addition to being quicker and easier to access, a benefit of using a mobile app as the platform for my project is it doesn’t require an internet connection.

2. **Learning Experience**: I also wanted to gain knowledge in mobile app development, given the prevalence of mobile applications in today’s digital landscape.

## Problem Solving

**CBT Toolbox** solves the problem of individuals struggling to use self-regulation tools when they aren’t in the Green Zone. It accomplishes this by providing a Toolbox tab with sections for each Zone (Blue, Yellow, and Red). Within these sections, users can customize a set of tools to help them return to the Green Zone. These tools include:

- **Breathing Exercise**: Customizable settings for different breathing techniques based on the user's current Zone.
- **Instruction**: The ability to type a message to oneself (e.g., "Walk away!") with optional image support.
- **Video**: Users can upload videos that bring them joy or help calm them down.

Users are encouraged to add these tools to their toolbox when they are in the Green Zone, ensuring they have easy access to the tools when needed. The application's home screen features blue, yellow, and red buttons. When pressed, these buttons display the tools associated with the corresponding Zone, making it effortless for users to access the right tools for their current state.

## What I Learned

In the process of developing **CBT Toolbox**, I gained valuable knowledge and skills, including:

- **React Native**: Building a mobile application using the React Native framework.
- **Expo**: Utilizing Expo for developing React Native applications.
- **React Navigation**: Implementing navigation within the application.
- **React Native Paper**: Creating a user-friendly interface with the React Native Paper library.
- **Asynchronous Data Storage**: Learning how to store data asynchronously to enhance user experience.

## What Makes My Project Stand Out

**CBT Toolbox** stands out for several reasons:

- **Beneficial to a Specific Audience**: It is specifically designed to benefit children and neurodivergent adults, addressing their unique needs and challenges.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: The application features a simple and intuitive user interface, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: It addresses and solves a real-world problem faced by individuals who have difficulty with self-regulation.
- **Research-Backed Principles**: The project is rooted in research-backed cognitive behavioral therapy principles, ensuring its effectiveness.

## Features

- **Toolbox**: Sections for the Blue Zone, Yellow Zone, and Red Zone, enabling individuals to quickly access the appropriate tools for their current state.
- **Customizable Tools**: Users can customize their toolbox with tools that work uniquely best for their self-regulation needs.
